# Tips and tricks

This chapter contains useful information that is not used often, but helpful in case of certain problems.

## Initialize your solution

Examples from [keil.arm.com](https://keil.arm.com) or solutions [created from scratch](./create_app.md) from the
**Create Solution** view are already initialized and contain all required files.

If your solution does not contain the `vcpkg-configuration.json`, `tasks.json`, and `launch.json` files, use the
**Initialize CMSIS project** option to generate them.

Right-click anywhere in the workspace and select **Initialize CMSIS project**. The extension generates preconfigured files
that are ready to use.

## Set current solution in workspace

To activate a solution in the **Solution** outline view, use the **Select solution from workspace** option in
**Views and More Actions...** ![Views and More Actions icon](./images/more-actions-icon.png).
